- When using xorm query without the table field, it will assumes the table name of a variable as the variable's struct name
- We need to set "HttpOnly: true" in cookie to prevent it from being stolen by JS code
- While annotating API function, there must not be spaces between annotation and the function 
- When running Elasticsearch without a proper server (for example running using docker), it saves data inside the docker container (/usr/share/elasticsearch/data), therefore, the data can't be access from any other device
- You should NEVER use the KEYS command in a production environment.
    The reason is that KEYS is a blocking operation. (When executing KEYS, the Redis server will stop processing everything and scan throughout the database -> freeze server for minutes)
